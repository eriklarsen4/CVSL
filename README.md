The `FreeAgencyAnalysis` directory contains two markdown files and the R script from which they were derived. This was a broad-level analysis of MLB free-agent spending from 2011-2021 for an article published on TheLeftyCatcher.com (https://www.theleftycatcher.com/post/free-agency-spending-trends-in-the-tanking-era). Graphs generated by both markdown files are contained in additional subdirectories.

The `CVSL` directory contains scripts for wrangling and modeling Strat-O-Matic dynasty/auction league rosters, etc.

The `Tanking` directory contains two markdown files and the R scripts from which they were derived. This was an evaluation of the 2012 Houston Astros and Chicago Cubs' tanking rebuilds for an article published on TheLeftyCatcher.com . Graphs generated by the graphing markdown file are contained in an additional subdirectory.

The `AnonEVandLA` directory contains one markdown file the R script from it was derived. This was part of a project to project anonymous players' exit velocities (EVs) from one or both of two unnamed batted ball tracking systems from one year's worth of data to another. Linear regression and median replacement to impute NAs. Generalized additive model to predict each hitter's batted ball metrics for each batted ball type. Weighted mean across batted ball type for the projection.

More subdirectories to come.
