# Baseball

The Free Agency Analysis directory contains two markdown files and the R script from which they were derived. This was a broad-level analysis of MLB free-agent spending in the last ten years. Graphs generated by both markdown files are contained in additional subdirectories.

The CVSL subdirectory contains scripts for wrangling and modeling Strat-O-Matic dynasty/auction league rosters, etc.

More subdirectories to come.
