# CVSL (Central Valley Strat-o-Matic League)

This repo contains scripts and files for **wrangling and modeling Strat-O-Matic dynasty/auction league rosters**, etc.

Along with containing the files that import and organize league data on a year-to-year basis (auction drafts, rosters, blind bids, etc.), I've also used the data as training grounds for modeling, and developing web apps.

More subdirectories to come.
