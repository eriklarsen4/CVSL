# CVSL (Central Valley Strat-o-Matic League)

This repo contains scripts and files that **wrangle and model Strat-O-Matic dynasty/auction league rosters**, etc. for the [Central Valley Strat-o-Matic League](https://sites.google.com/view/cvslbaseball/home).

Along with containing the files that import and organize league data on a year-to-year basis (auction drafts, rosters, blind bid "drafts", etc.), I've also used the data as training grounds for modeling and developing web apps.

I'm still re-organizing the repo where yearly analyses and files are contained within their own subdirectories, while more general data/processes/goals/files do not have a home subdirectory.
