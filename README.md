# Baseball

The "FreeAgencyAnalysis" directory contains two markdown files and the R script from which they were derived. This was a broad-level analysis of MLB free-agent spending from 2011-2021 for an article published on TheLeftyCatcher.com (https://www.theleftycatcher.com/post/free-agency-spending-trends-in-the-tanking-era). Graphs generated by both markdown files are contained in additional subdirectories.

The "CVSL" subdirectory contains scripts for wrangling and modeling Strat-O-Matic dynasty/auction league rosters, etc.

More subdirectories to come.
